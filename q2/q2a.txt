The vulnerability in this section was there was an unsafe use of strcat.
There was no length checking for the password and it was passed into the strcat as is, and a buffer overflow occured.
Using this we could just input a long password to overwrite the ra and crash the program.
We used an informative input so we would understand where the ra is by reading the esp.
This caused a segmentation fault.
