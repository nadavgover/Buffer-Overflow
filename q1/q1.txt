The vulnerability in this code was using strcat with not matching sizes.
Since the buffer length is 20, and 10 bytes are already full and that the password is also 10 bytes long,
So we actually can get to the address buffer[20] (normally buffer[19] would be \0) and put there whatever we want.
Using IDA and the sudo.c file we can see that the variable auth is right above the buffer on the stack.
So if we overflow the buffer it actually overflows into auth.
We can see that when auth is 1 the validation is returns true. 
Since auth was already initialized to zero, if we change the last bit of it to 1, it will be 1.
This would not work if auth was not initialized to zero because then the high bytes of auth (the bytes we don't have access to) will not be zero.
So using this fact, we can put in the last byte of our password the value of 1. 
And that will do the job.
